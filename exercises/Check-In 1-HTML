    <h2> What is <i>Anathema?</i></h2>
   
        <p> <i>Anathema</i> is an upcoming graphic novel created by Marlie Fitch. Inspired by a wide variety of manga and role-playing<br> video games, this graphic novel transforms tropes found within these mediums to create something entirely new.</p>

    <h2> The Story Begins... </h2>

    <p>In the land of Khaos: a lost continent drifting in the Abyss. The story follows Blaise Kresnik,<br> a knight in training who encounters a mysterious young man who broke into his home. The young man, clenching a<br> black crystal in his hand, enacts a forbidden ritual. His soul is transferred inside Blaise’s body. The two struggle for control<br> over Blaise’s body, meanwhile right outside his home, enemy forces invade the country...</p>
   <h3> Volume I of <i>Anathema</i> consists of five chapters:</h3>
        <ol>
        <li>Aoife</li>
        <li>Together Forever</li>

    </ol>

    <h2> Development History</h2>
     <p>While <i>Anathema</i> is a graphic novel, it was my love for video game storytelling that inspired me to create a story of my own.<br> Series like <i>Megami Tensei</i>, <i>Fire Emblem</i>, and <i>Kill the Past</i> have deeply influenced both my art and writing style. Elements from<br> these series can be felt within the world of <i>Anathema</i>, yet are transformed in order to create a unique reading experience.</p>
            <p> In 2021, I had a vague idea of a plotline and characters for <i>Anathema</i>, but it wasn’t until 2023 when I finally began working<br> on the series. While my enrollment as a full-time student created many hiatuses, my passion and love for this project has led <br>me to dedicate at least one hour per day into <i>Anathema</i> (and often would one hour turn into two hours, then three, then four, then...).</p>
   
        <h3> Production Timeline</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><b>2021 | Conception Stages:</b> <i>Anathema</i> was nothing more than an idea.</li>
        <li><b>2023 | Early Production:</b> a few pages were created in Clip Studio Paint to test out the art style.</li>
        <li><b>2024-2025 | Main Production:</b> The majority of Volume I were made during these years, with there still being hiatuses along the way due to college.</li>
        <li><b>2026 | Completion of Volume I:</b> <i>Anathema Volume I</i> is planned to come out in the summer of 2026!</li>
    </ul>

     <p> <i>Anathema</i> still has a long way to go from here, but with the release of Volume I on the horizon, the story is only beginning!</p>
